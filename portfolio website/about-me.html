                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Hi! My name is Stephan Sierra Perdomo. I'm 21 years old and born in The Netherlands. During my time at CMD I've found out I <em>really</em> love front-end! I've never done it before I went to this school, but I was immediately hooked once I had the chance to make awesome stuff. Of course I'm still learning the ropes, but I feel like I've really found something I enjoy doing and hopefully will keep doing in the future! Oh, and if you want to check out my CV, please click on the button.</p>

                <h2>Hard Skills</h2>
                <p>Spoiler alert: I'm still mostly a beginner ;)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Front-end: Beginner</h3>
                        <p>Even though I LOVE front-end, of course I still have a bunch to learn - heck even this website itself took me a long time to figure out! Still, I know how to do basic stuff as working with flex, grid, making websites accessible and responsive - even though it might take me a bit longer...</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>UI design/protoyping: Beginner</h3>
                        <p>This is something I enjoy doing, but I don't think I have quite that feel for it yet. I mostly work with this in Adobe XD, but I did recently discover Figma which works real nice. I just gotta keep making designs and practice!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Motion Design: Intermediate</h3>
                        <p>Having worked in this field for a while, I am a bit more familiar with motion design. I do this work in After Effects. Of course, I still would like to learn more advanced techniques in the future. Maybe even 3D animation?</p>

                        <h3>Video editing: Intermediate</h3>
                        <p>I've never done profesional work for this, but I'm really comfortable working in any video editing software (especially Adobe Premiere).</p>
