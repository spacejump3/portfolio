            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Create your own version of an existing website. Make it from scratch and improve on the original website. Think of things like responsiveness and accessibility. Recreate a total of two pages. There's also a catch: using classes is not allowed.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Creating this website was basically a two-step process. The first step was researching the original website: does this website work without a mouse? Using a screenreader? Can I use this website with impaired vision/mobility? These are all things I had to test out for myself and try to improve when making my version of the website. I also made a 'website breakdown' where I went through the entire page to figure out how it was made. Whichs elements are the list items, buttons, links etc.</p>
            <p>The second step is of course creating my own version of the website. I accomplished this by starting out with the HTML and going from there. Once the basic building blocks were there, I could begin styling, making hover and focus states and generally trying to make things really nice. Not being able to use classes was a pain, but I learned to really stop relying on them during this process.</p>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>In the end I made a responsive website with correct heading levels, focus states and a dark/light mode. I'm really happy with the end result and I've learned a lot of new techniques.</p>
