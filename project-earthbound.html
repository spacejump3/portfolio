            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>The assignment was to create a game using mostly JavaScript. In this case I chose to make an RPG like battle sequence.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>So to make this battle sequence, I needed to make a bunch of menu's. So I had to pre-make every menu in HTML and hide most of them using CSS. So the trick to this website is mostly unhiding a bunch of menu's via JavaScript. Then for the health and damage I had to make loads of variables for them. Then for the attacks, I first check if the health for the enemy or me is above 0. Then do a certain amount of damage depending on which attack I used. Eventually, if I win, I get a win screen. If I lose, I get a lose screen.</p>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>The result is a simple one page website where you can attack an enemy using different abilities. You can win or lose and there are animations for every attack. I enjoyed working on it since it was my first real challenge with JavaScript.</p>
