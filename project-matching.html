            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Create a matching app where you using nodejs, a templating engine and a database. The 'matches' should be stored in the database and rendered onto the results view.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>I wanted to make an app where you can select your interests using a form, and based on your choices, different results would show up. I made this using a form which sends the inputs to the database, which then returns objects with the corresponding checkboxes you selected.</p> 
            <p>To start off I had to install all the necessary application to get this server running. I needed git, express, nodejs and ejs. So with that I created a repository and started to make a simple server to see if it worked. Whenever that was done, I could start making my views and creating routes in my index.js. The final thing to do was create a connection with the MongoDB database, make some collections in there and it was all done!</p>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <video width="800" src="/video/matching-vid.mkv" type="video/mp4" controls></video>
            <p>The result is a simple web application which retrieves data from a database. It was definitely hard to figure everything out, but it was a valuable learning experience.</p>
